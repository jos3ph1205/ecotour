            Hispaniola is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the
            Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second
            largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most
            populous island in the world.

         <br />
         <p>
            Hispaniola is the site of the first permanent European settlement in
            the Americas, founded by Christopher Columbus on his voyages in 1492
            and 1493.

               Hispaniola is the second largest island of the West Indies, with
               an area of about 76,126 km². The name given to the island was
               Columbus. Hispaniola means "small Spain". The Tainos called the
               island "Quisqueya", Mother Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
               From a geological point of view, the island of Hispaniola is part
               of two branches of the North American cordillera system and is
               about 660 km long, 250 km wide and extends west-easterly. In the
               west, the island of Hispaniola is separated by the approximately
               90 km wide Windward Passage from Cuba and in the east by the Mona
               Passage from Puerto Rico, which is up to 110 km wide.
            </p>
            <p>
               On the island of Hispaniola lie five large mountain chains. The
               highest mountains of the Caribbean are in the Dominican Republic.
               The highest mountain is in Pico Duarte with 3098 meters above sea
               level. Also the deepest point of the Caribbean lies on
               Hispaniola: the salt lake Enriquillo in the southwest of the
               Dominican Republic.
            </p>
            <p>
               Hispaniola offers four vegetation zones and five climatic zones.
               More than 5000 plant species, many of the endemic, make the
               island a paradise for nature lovers. The animal world is also
               convincing, although it is not possible to affect large animals
               except for a few species. For this, the bird world is represented
               even more arsenically.

               The island of Hispaniola is divided into two countries Dominican
               Republic and Haiti. ⅔ the island belongs to the territory of the
               Dominican Republic and ⅓ Haiti. Although both countries are on an
               island, the landscape, cultural and social differences are huge.

            <p>
               The island of Hispaniola (La Isla Espanola) was the first colony
               in the New World settled by Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
               As such, it served as a logistical base for the conquest of most
               of the Western Hemisphere. Christopher Columbus first sighted the
               island in 1492 toward the end of his first voyage to "the
               Indies".
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="col">
            <p>
               For two centuries the Spanish ruled the island until western
               Hispaniola (present-day Haiti) came under French control in 1697.
               The ease still remained under Spanish control. This created a
               division that still exists today, with the Dominican Republic and
               Haiti sharing the island.
            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, and after the decades of unstable political situations,
               on 27 February 1844, the territory of Santo Domingo recovered its
               sovereignty and declared its independence as the Dominican
               Republic.

               Wild mountain streams, hidden caves and dreamy waterfalls can be
               visited on guided tours in the mountains. Walks through tropical
               mountain forests, biking at the beaches and safaris for bird and
               bird watching are just a few of the recommendations that we can
               give you.
